# Ransomware Detection Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Project Overview

Ransomware attacks have emerged as a major global cybersecurity threat, impacting countless organizations and causing significant financial and operational damage. This project explores the potential of unsupervised machine learning algorithms for ransomware detection, focusing on the ability to identify and cluster ransomware files effectively.

### Key Features:
- Comparative analysis of **five unsupervised learning models**:  
  1. **K-Means Clustering**  
  2. **Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)**  
  3. **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**  
  4. **Hierarchical Clustering**  
  5. **Autoencoder + K-Means**  

- Evaluation Metrics:  
  Models are evaluated using the following metrics to assess clustering quality:  
  - **Homogeneity**  
  - **Completeness**  
  - **V-Measure**  
  - **Calinski-Harabasz Score**  
  - **Silhouette Score**

- Identification of high-performing models for ransomware detection.  
- Insights into dimensionality reduction techniques, including Autoencoders, and their integration with clustering algorithms.

## Results and Insights

### Key Findings:
1. **Autoencoder + K-Means**  
   - Demonstrates the highest **Calinski-Harabasz Score**, indicating excellent cluster separation.  
   - Achieves strong **Homogeneity**, **Completeness**, and **V-Measure** scores, signifying well-defined and meaningful clusters.

2. **DBSCAN**  
   - Produces the highest **Silhouette Score**, forming compact and distinct clusters.  
   - Performs well in **Homogeneity**, though completeness is limited due to noise labeling.

3. **GMM**  
   - Offers a balance between **Homogeneity** and **Completeness**, reflected in a strong **V-Measure** score.  
   - However, lower **Silhouette Scores** suggest overlapping clusters.

4. **Hierarchical Clustering**  
   - Exhibits the weakest performance, highlighting its limitations in this domain.

5. **K-Means Clustering**  
   - Provides average results without forming highly distinct clusters.

## Conclusion and Future Directions

This project identifies **Autoencoder + K-Means** as a promising tool for ransomware detection, leveraging dimensionality reduction to improve clustering quality. Future research can focus on:
- Testing other dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) to enhance clustering performance.  
- Experimenting with advanced clustering algorithms to optimize cluster definition.  
- Scaling the approach for larger, more complex datasets to explore real-time clustering applications.  
- Balancing computational efficiency with model accuracy for practical deployment.
